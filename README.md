# bee-bee

COMM LAB hw for this week: CREATE a story in 3 Images (a.k.a. the power of sequencing) - collect 3 images (your own photos, screen grabs, doodles, cut from magazines, etc) that "tell a story" in TWO different ways. Each version MUST have a beginning, a middle, and an end. They can exist on paper, on a web page, wherever - just need to be able to present and share it with the class.
